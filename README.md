## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Installation

Please follow the requirements.txt file to install the relevant dependencies or run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Since our method modifies the transformers of huggingface, please make sure to install the same transformers as ours (we use transformers version 4.44.2):

cd transformers
pip install -e .

### 2. Datasets

We used two datasets

APPS
EffiBench

### 3. Finetuning
